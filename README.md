# 🌟 Introducing "NutriGuide: Personalized Food & Diet Recommendations" 🌟

I am thrilled to share my latest project, NutriGuide, a cutting-edge food and diet recommendation system designed to help individuals make healthier dietary choices effortlessly. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to provide personalized recipe suggestions based on individual nutritional needs and ingredient preferences.

# 📌 Project Overview:

NutriGuide is a Flask-based web application that offers tailored recipe recommendations by analyzing both nutritional content and ingredient lists. Users can input their dietary requirements and ingredient preferences to receive a curated list of recipes that best meet their needs.

# 🎯 Objective:

To empower individuals to maintain a balanced diet by offering personalized recipe suggestions that cater to their specific nutritional requirements and ingredient preferences.

# 🔧 Technology Used:

Flask: For building the web application.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
TF-IDF Vectorization: For processing and analyzing ingredient lists.
StandardScaler: For normalizing numerical nutritional data.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): For generating recipe recommendations.

# 🏢 Organizational Benefits:

NutriGuide can be a valuable tool for health and wellness companies, nutritionists, and dietitians by:
Enhancing client engagement through personalized diet plans.
Streamlining the process of creating balanced meal plans.
Providing a data-driven approach to dietary recommendations.
